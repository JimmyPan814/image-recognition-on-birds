# image-recognition-on-birds

Fine-grained Image recognition has become popular these years. People are trying to detect objects through cameras such as detection when a vehicle is coming to check whether the vehicle exceeds the speed limit. Most detections are based on recognizing different species. But what about detection on different kinds of one specific species such as different kinds of birds? People are not that familiar with specific categories of birds. So, in this study a dataset of bird-species images with annotations and attributes are chosen. To recognize each category of bird, this work will show fine-grained image recognition, which is a challenging task. By adopting different algorithms to recognize which category it is for birds by given images, accuracy of our algorithms will be presented as the performance of recognizing images.
